# Will Lambda

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you.

## Features

- **Zero administration**: No need to worry about server provisioning, monitoring, maintenance, scaling, or patching.
- **Continuous scaling**: Automatically scales your application by running code in response to each trigger.
- **Subsecond metering**: Pay only for the compute time you consume.
- **Integrated security model**: Automatically execute code in response to HTTP requests via Amazon API Gateway, or expose your code as a RESTful API.
- **Integrated monitoring**: Monitor your functions in near real-time using Amazon CloudWatch.
