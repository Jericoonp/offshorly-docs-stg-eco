# AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you.

## Features

- **Zero administration**: No need to worry about server provisioning, monitoring, maintenance, scaling, or patching.
- **Continuous scaling**: Automatically scales your application by running code in response to each trigger.
